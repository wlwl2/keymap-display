# keymap-display package

![Image of keymap-display modal shown](images/tree-view.png)

Displays custom keymaps with a nice interface.

Press `alt-j` to toggle the keymap display (shown/hidden).

Press `alt-k` to switch between groups of keyboard shortcuts. Alternatively, click on the group buttons to switch between groups of keyboard shortcuts.

Currently only supports custom keymaps and keymaps from packages,
not reassigned default keymaps.

Todo: add support for all keymaps and maybe a search bar.
